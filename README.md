# Sales Prediction Model
This repository implements a machine learning pipeline to forecast sales for retail products at multiple outlet stores.

## Key Features
* Loads and preprocesses dataset of 8,500+ records with rich feature sets on items, outlets, and historical sales
* Applies several regression models:
     * Lasso
     * Ridge
     * Random Forest
     * Gradient Boosting
     * Linear Regression
* Tuning of hyperparameters via GridSearch cross-validation
* Modular code structure for easy re-use and extensibility
* Comprehensive EDA and data visualization
* Rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing
* Quantitative model evaluation
* Well documented for transparency
## Overview
The pipeline follows these key steps:

* Exploratory data analysis
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training and evaluation
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Analysis of feature importance
## Usage
The code serves as a template for developing sales forecasting systems using machine learning techniques. It can be reused for other regression problems as well.
